        <p>Having <a href="/finding-an-idea/">talked about how to think about ideas</a>, the natural next step is to list them down in one place. That’s what this page is all about. It includes the results of both thought processes (that I described in the previous post).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the always up-to-date list of ideas. I continuously add ideas here, and <del>mark off the ideas that have died</del>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This particular list include a dump of all the technologies that match my background. Essentially:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read the list of technologies / trends</li>
  <li>Map to my work experience — does anything fit?</li>
  <li>List everything, filter later</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bitcoinblockchain">Bitcoin/Blockchain</h2>

<ul>
  <li>[Consumer] Remittance network across borders</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>GE</strong> : Can be used to diagnose problems with critical machinery (the way the Machinery Diagnostics folks used to do when I was there, and still do).</li>
  <li><strong>Canvas.bh:</strong> Image effects, enlargement without loss in quality. There’s an opportunity to make real magic happen with Machine Learning and Imaging.</li>
  <li><strong>White/Payfort:</strong> The most obvious one is anti-fraud, from both the transactional side as well as the merchant on-boarding side.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="insurance">Insurance</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Payfort [B2B]:</strong> Crowdsourced insurance against chargebacks from merchants themselves as opposed to some 3rd party.</li>
  <li><strong>All [Consumer]:</strong> Founder/startup insurance, where you get a payout if your idea fails to get traction to keep you alive until the next thing (or until you get hired). This could be funded by hiring companies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="human-augmentation">Human Augmentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/the-goals-idea/"><del>Goals app</del></a> The way that large companies propagate high-level goals down from leadership to employees across the company is broken. It ends up becoming a formality, done over Powerpoint slides twice a year (beginning and end, during performance reviews). This is a lost opportunity, one where goals could serve as the glue that ties employees daily work towards a greater company objective. Coupled with transparency, employees can see exactly how they impact the greater goals.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="financial-services">Financial Services</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>White [Consumer / B2B]:</strong> Payouts, Inc. Essentially, a TransferWise across the region (can be either B2B, B2C or both). Create a web of bank accounts at all popular banks and facilitate instant transfers across all the banks (even cross-country) via a simple API.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-random-ideas">Other, random ideas</h2>

<ul>
  <li>“Wasoot” — automatically follow people that have similar interests.</li>
  <li>“Google Analytics for SaaS” [B2B] — a map of the path that your user takes when interacting with you application. See exactly what actions are taken, and which ones result in your users dropping off.</li>
  <li>Online community for the competitive startup founders [Consumer]; those motivated by competition. Focus on transparency, learning and most importantly: <em>results</em> .</li>
  <li>RealEstate 2.0: How can you make it 10x easier to get a property sold? How can you make it 10x better for sellers/buyers?</li>
  <li>Simple Workflow tool (like SupportCentral @ GE, KissFlow) that makes it easier to get stuff done inside teams. Drag and drop, done.</li>
  <li>Private photo sharing, with the Middle East in mind [Consumer]. I suck at sharing photos that I take — and usually see sending them over Whatsapp as such a chore (it’s a bad UX either way, for both sender and receiver). Better way?</li>
  <li><a href="/the-gforms-idea/"><del>GoogleForms++</del></a>: A forms app that works on mobile and is offline. Maybe include an Android widget so you can tap, tap, done.</li>
  <li><a href="/the-validator/"><del>The Validator</del></a>: A simple tool that helps you validate an idea quickly. No more slogging through creating a landing page, hooking up Intercom, etc. A/B testing messaging and testing experiments. This tool has all the best practices built-in, and makes the process smooth as silk. $99/month (you’ll save so much time and money!)</li>
  <li>“Marketplace glue ideas” where you can patch supply with demand in a much more streamlined way. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Canvas art, where you offer a mobile app where customers can upload pictures from their recent vacations, and they are printed and delivered from local canvas printers (at a margin). The advantage is that you can expand geographically anywhere you have a few key local suppliers. Also, you don’t worry about inventory, etc.</li>
      <li>Home repair services, where you take a photo / video of whatever needs fixing and send it off to local repair shops (plumbers, electricians, etc.). You have a handyman in your pocket, with reviews to keep off the bad folks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s clear that I’ve got <em>A LOT</em> of ideas, and this list will only grow larger with time. Hence, I need to figure out a way to validate ideas quickly. I’ll put a process in place once I’ve tested a few of these ideas out.</p>
