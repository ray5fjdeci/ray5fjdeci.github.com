This one goes like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A forms app that works on mobile and is offline. Maybe include an Android widget so you can tap, tap, done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subscription service, that offers the ability to submit Google Forms offline. I use GForms alot, and I’m betting there’s others out there that do too (how many there are remains a question that needs answering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the ability to submit forms offline means people that use it for expense tracking can do so painlessly, and from anywhere — those that use it for any other sort of mobile tracking can do the same. It would be very useful to a small set of people that (a) use Google Forms frequently and (b) are on the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I have no idea how the heck people could possibly use this (and indeed, if anyone would want to use this thing) — hence, the experiment. All I know is that there are many, many users of Google products and if even a small subset of those will find this beneficial, then there’s plenty of room to make a business here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach-to-validation&quot;&gt;Approach to Validation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;landing-page&quot;&gt;Landing Page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I didn’t use the Business Model Canvas, since I’m not sure what the use-case (and hence, the market) is for this product. Instead, I’ll use a landing page showing this feature — and launch it on HackerNews / ProductHunt. That way, I’ll guage the response and create a specific product based on the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what I’ll do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a simple landing page showing the main feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch it on HackerNews / ProductHunt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to signups and ask them why they signed up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a specific product based on feedback&lt;/li&gt;

The description I had from &lt;a href=&quot;/list-of-ideas&quot;&gt;the Ideas list&lt;/a&gt; is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The way that large companies propagate high-level goals down from leadership to employees across the company is broken. It ends up becoming a formality, done over Powerpoint slides twice a year (beginning and end, during performance reviews). This is a lost opportunity, one where goals could serve as the glue that ties employees daily work towards a greater company objective. Coupled with transparency, employees can see exactly how they impact the greater goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach-to-validation&quot;&gt;Approach to Validation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-model-canvas&quot;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is the first idea I’ll be validating, I’d like to try out the most obvious method — the infamous Business Model Canvas. So I fill it in like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/business-model-canvas-goals-idea.png&quot; alt=&quot;Business Model Canvas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent about 30 minutes filling that in (I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanstack.com/&quot;&gt;LeanStack&lt;/a&gt; to get it done). Ok, the idea was pretty vague when I started — and now it does seem &lt;em&gt;abit&lt;/em&gt; more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;riskiest-assumption&quot;&gt;Riskiest Assumption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step would be to “validate my riskiest assumption”. I’ll list down all of the assumptions I have going on (aside from the canvas, in it’s entirety):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large companies still share goals via Powerpoint slides twice a year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large companies &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; transparency in their goals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees are incentivized to use the tool and can benefit from it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge I’m sensing in this goal is a greater one — one that relates to product adoption. How the heck am I going to convince a large corporation (one with 1k+ employees) to pay for a tool that doesn’t yet exist — and for a problem that they may not even be aware they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tall order indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s our concern then: &lt;strong&gt;do customers know they have a problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have no intention of building the product without paying customers lined up, I’m necessarily going to have to start with smaller companies (&amp;lt;100 employees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;validate-it&quot;&gt;Validate It&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to test out this assumption, I decided to run some interviews. For this, I primarily relied on &lt;a href=&quot;http://customerdevlabs.com/2013/11/05/how-i-interview-customers/&quot;&gt;Justin Wilcox’s proven interviewing tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My process was simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to small businesses (with between 10 - 100 employees)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interview the Founder/CEO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analyze results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach out to the founders, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattermark.com&quot;&gt;MatterMark’s dashboard search&lt;/a&gt;. It’s awesome because it lets you search companies by number of employees. I then wrote emails out to the Founder/CEO’s of the first 50 companies on the list. The email address is often firstname@company.domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what one of those emails looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/email-strategy-interview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected to hear back from half of the folks — so about 25 (especially since I offered to compensate them for their time, something I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/74338272&quot;&gt;Jason Cohen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also drafted a few questions that I’d ask in the interview. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who defines the strategy for the company?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is it communicated with the employees?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What tools do you use?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How often is the strategy revisited with the employees to align tasks with larger goals?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was more to guide the discussion — I expected to be asking alot if “why” questions too, to understand what was going on underneath the surface. I did not plan to do &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; selling on this call — that would happen later, once we’ve validated that customers are aware of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 0 positive responses within 3 days of sending the email out. 5 people replied to kindly say no, they were not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s reasonable to assume that if they really did have a hard time communicating the company strategy throughout the organization, they would’ve replied (barring some sort of email deliverability issue, which I knew was not the case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revisiting-the-business-model-canvas&quot;&gt;Revisiting the Business Model Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to my business model canvas, and thought about my definition of early adopter. It was, of course, super-general. Maybe there was some way to narrow it down to a smaller group that face a more severe variant of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal group of early adopters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have the problem you defined&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;know they have the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are paying to “solve it” (albeit, inadequately)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks I’m reaching out to meet none of these criteria (which may be why the acceptance rate is so dismal). Seems like I’ll need to be much more specific about what folks I’m looking for here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the problem more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to help &lt;strong&gt;entrepreneurs&lt;/strong&gt; solve their &lt;strong&gt;strategy communication&lt;/strong&gt; problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t seem to be able to &lt;strong&gt;define&lt;/strong&gt; the problem, and therefore I can’t even begin to fix it. I’ve tried searching for externally observable behaviors that suggest that this problem exists (e.g. “i don’t know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to work on! too many tasks on &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;”) on Twitter but couldn’t find anything. I also tried searching for blog posts, etc. and also came up short. So while this problem may seem like it might exist somewhere, I have no conceivable way of detecting (let alone reaching) those that have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, there’s nothing more to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiment failed, because I was unable to find people that face the purported problem this idea solves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is the first idea I'm testing.

That’s what this post is about. It includes the results of both thought processes (that I described in the previous post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular list include a dump of all the technologies that match my background. Essentially:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the list of technologies / trends&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Map to my work experience — does anything fit?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List everything, filter later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bitcoinblockchain&quot;&gt;Bitcoin/Blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Consumer] Remittance network across borders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;machine-learning&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GE&lt;/strong&gt; : Can be used to diagnose problems with critical machinery (the way the Machinery Diagnostics folks used to do when I was there, and still do).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas.bh:&lt;/strong&gt; Image effects, enlargement without loss in quality. There’s an opportunity to make real magic happen with Machine Learning and Imaging.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White/Payfort:&lt;/strong&gt; The most obvious one is anti-fraud, from both the transactional side as well as the merchant on-boarding side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;insurance&quot;&gt;Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payfort [B2B]:&lt;/strong&gt; Crowdsourced insurance against chargebacks from merchants themselves as opposed to some 3rd party.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All [Consumer]:&lt;/strong&gt; Founder/startup insurance, where you get a payout if your idea fails to get traction to keep you alive until the next thing (or until you get hired). This could be funded by hiring companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-augmentation&quot;&gt;Human Augmentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GE [Consumer]:&lt;/strong&gt; The way that large companies propagate high-level goals down from leadership to employees across the company is broken. It ends up becoming a formality, done over Powerpoint slides twice a year (beginning and end, during performance reviews). This is a lost opportunity, one where goals could serve as the glue that ties employees daily work towards a greater company objective. Coupled with transparency, employees can see exactly how they impact the greater goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;financial-services&quot;&gt;Financial Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White [Consumer / B2B]:&lt;/strong&gt; Payouts, Inc. Essentially, a TransferWise across the region (can be either B2B, B2C or both). Create a web of bank accounts at all popular banks and facilitate instant transfers across all the banks (even cross-country) via a simple API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-random-ideas&quot;&gt;Other, random ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Google Analytics for SaaS” [B2B] — a map of the path that your user takes when interacting with you application. See exactly what actions are taken, and which ones result in your users dropping off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online community for the competitive startup founders [Consumer]; those motivated by competition. Focus on transparency, learning and most importantly: &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RealEstate 2.0: How can you make it 10x easier to get a property sold? How can you make it 10x better for sellers/buyers?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple Workflow tool (like SupportCentral @ GE, KissFlow) that makes it easier to get stuff done inside teams. Drag and drop, done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private photo sharing, with the Middle East in mind [Consumer]. I suck at sharing photos that I take — and usually see sending them over Whatsapp as such a chore (it’s a bad UX either way, for both sender and receiver). Better way?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GoogleForms++&lt;/strong&gt;: A forms app that works on mobile and is offline. Maybe include an Android widget so you can tap, tap, done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Validator&lt;/strong&gt;: A simple tool that helps you validate an idea quickly. No more slogging through creating a landing page, hooking up Intercom, etc. A/B testing messaging and testing experiments. This tool has all the best practices built-in, and makes the process smooth as silk. $99/month (you’ll save so much time and money!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that I’ve got &lt;em&gt;A LOT&lt;/em&gt; of ideas, and this list will only grow larger with time. Hence, I need to figure out a way to validate ideas quickly. I’ll put a process in place once I’ve tested a few of these ideas out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Having talked about how to think about ideas, the natural next step is to list them down in one place. That’s what this post is about.

&lt;p&gt;Finding something to work on can be daunting. When you choose to work on something, you’re also choosing &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to work on countless other things. The FOMO beast in me wreaks havoc at the mere mention of such a quandary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I do? How can I take a decision — the right decision — at a time when there are so many things going on in so many different fields. For a split second, I want to dive into all of them: Biotechnology, Nutrition, Self-driving cars, Machine Learning, Nanotechnology, Bitcoin, Drones and so many more! There’s so much to learn, and so &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; time! (It doesn’t help that I’m addicted to learning, and enjoy it immensely — even for it’s own sake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I come back to my senses, I realize that’s why it’s crucial to have a framework for making decisions: a plan, based on a &lt;em&gt;key insight&lt;/em&gt; . Similar to how Jeff Bezos, all those years ago, decided that books would be a great foundation for starting an eCommerce company, since there are way too many titles to keep under one roof: since variety is key, this lead to the ultimate defensible business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so simple — but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in retrospect. The idea now is to come up with such insights looking forward, and building a defensible business upon a key insight — essentially, to pull a “Jeff Bezos”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;approach&quot;&gt;Approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-level approach is a simple one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get as many ideas as possible. The more, the merrier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mercilessly kill the bad ideas. Oh, and make sure you do it quickly and painlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post will include a framework I devised for brainstorming ideas based on my unique experiences and interests. The approach is one that can be generalized to your case, with a little bit of self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-alot-of-ideas&quot;&gt;Getting alot of ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-obvious-way-brainstorming&quot;&gt;The obvious way (Brainstorming)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious way to generate alot of ideas is to just do a brain-dump. Grab a bunch of sticky notes, a marker and write out as many ideas as you can in 5 minutes. The limitation with this approach though is that the results are inconsistent — and the ideas you get are largely influenced by whatever it is your brain was busy thinking about &lt;em&gt;at that specific time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-methodical-way&quot;&gt;The methodical way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the limitations of the first method, I decided to also use a more methodical approach for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the post describes this methodical approach in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations for finding a business idea:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ride a Technological Wave&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My Background &amp;amp; Expertise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider Regional Challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-ride-a-technological-wave&quot;&gt;① Ride a Technological Wave&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some technologies today that are going to fundamentally change how existing businesses operate. This is the perfect time to pick those up, understand the implications that they might have on incumbents and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be thorough about this would require exhaustive study of all technological changes, and a detailed dive into each one to understand how it might affect existing markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VCs are perfectly positioned to write about these things, since they are on the receiving end of many startup proposals (many of which are built on top of existing technological waves).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can benefit from their insight here to help us get from a broad matrix of markets and technologies to a more narrowly focused list that I can then select from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-my-background--expertise&quot;&gt;② My Background &amp;amp; Expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal startup will build on my strengths — both industry-specific and otherwise. While it’s certainly possible to excel in a field I have no experience in (I knew nothing about credit cards before White), it’s preferable to choose one that I know well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take stock of what areas I’m good at, and have experience in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gemeasurement.com/condition-monitoring-and-protection&quot;&gt;Condition Monitoring &amp;amp; Vibration Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lean Six Sigma&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SAP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Print Industry (print.bh)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fine Art Canvas (canvas.bh)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online Payments &amp;amp; Credit Cards (whitepayments.com)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drones (Teleport)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These span multiple industries (⚡️ Energy, 🖨 Print, 💲 Payments) and disciplines (Engineering, Quality, Founder, Product).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Strengths:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I learn &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; . I savor the acceleration in learning (going from 0% knowledge about something→80% of it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have an innate ability to simplify complicated things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I know how to plan, and plan well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open to feedback, in all it’s forms. No matter how harsh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;complexities&lt;/em&gt; worst enemy. I can take super complicated things, and break them down into bite-size, easy-to-understand chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Weaknesses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hate slogging through the remaining 20% (from 80→100%).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can make the high-level plan, and execute the big juicy parts of it — but won’t comb through the minutiae.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-consider-regional-challenges&quot;&gt;③ Consider Regional Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of this talk about technological change will influence the world equally. The Middle East is still behind the US in some fundamental aspects of doing business e.g. logistics, payments and (perhaps as a result) eCommerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;All problems must be verified&lt;/em&gt; (we assume they are true, but they might not be)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High mobile penetration, low availability of &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; online services (Uber/Careem are notable exceptions). No clear market leader equivalent of eBay, Shyp, TaskRabbit, Stripe (or underlying ACH/SEPA for that matter). 
Recent entrants: Instashop (=Instacart).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key learning from my time in eCommerce: mobile is exploding, and people will buy online where there’s an incentive to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Financial inclusion: reaching the X-million people that don’t have bank accounts or credit cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of credit history for individuals and companies in the region&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of delivery infrastructure to non-core cities in Saudi Arabia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry-specific challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;⚡️ Energy
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The UAE has the largest per capita carbon footprint in the world [ &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.kpmg.com/ae/en/home/insights/2016/09/goinggreen-renewableopportunitiesintheuae.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , 2016]&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dependence on oil [ &lt;a href=&quot;http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Middle-East-Oil-Addiction-Could-Spell-Disaster.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , 2015]&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cost of renewables without subsidies near parity with fossil fuel in the UAE [ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/energy-science-center-dam/events/the-global-energy-challenge/steven-hartman-ge-presentation.pdf&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , Pg8, 2017]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🖨 Print
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Print industry in Middle East is … booming? [ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smitherspira.com/news/2017/march/middle-east-presents-new-boom-market-for-print&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , 2017]. They still have to contend with lower and lower prices though.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;💲 Payments
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Still no way for individuals to process online payments, without having to get a Trade License (for AED10k+). Stripe users &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.stripe.com/questions/sole-proprietor-without-federal-ein&quot;&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No Payouts infrastructure available for doing cheap/free bank transfers across the UAE (nevermind the region)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Transfers across the region go through SWIFT, and cost ~AED50/transfer (plus currency exchange fees)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this all work, I’ll start by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matching technologies up with my strengths/background&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tying the resulting list with the list of the region’s problems to check suitability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a key insight for each remaining idea _ (where possible)_&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I also want to leave room for random ideas that might not necessarily have surfaced through any of the previous steps. It’s totally fine to not overthink them, as long as we develop a quick way to test these ideas for viability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The first step is finding an idea, one of the most intimidating parts of this whole process.
