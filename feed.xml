I do know that people in Bahrain buy &amp;amp; sell real-estate the same way they have in the pre-web era. The only difference is that now there’s a bunch of websites (really, not very different than catalogs, or newspaper classifieds) that advertise properties. The transaction is always initiated via a phone call, followed by a site visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s certainly room for improvement — but before doing anything, the first step has to be about discovery. Don’t try to fix something you don’t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to understand the “real estate process”; you could ask the agents, people that want to buy a property, or the owners — those are the primary parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, and because I know very little about the space, I’ll start by attempting to buy a property (masquerading as a buyer). This will allow me to start at the beginning (a buyer shows interest), and then branch out to the other process directions (how did the owner list the property?) and (how does the realtor close the sale).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I’ll do this until I feel like I’ve nailed the process (i.e. I can predict exactly what steps the next realtor will follow, to the t). That’ll probably take about 30 tries to do, maybe more. We’ll see…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-buying-process&quot;&gt;The Buying Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I setup viewings for 8 properties with various real-estate agents, and sourced through multiple websites. Here’s a list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXSc5S8ijY2ShoBPCKH3O6WUlaLJoOVJTm-7HsWib7A/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;amp;single=true&amp;amp;widget=true&amp;amp;headers=false&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:350px;border:1px solid #ccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having gone through all of these viewings, here’s what the buying process looks like visually, with some notes of the things I found odd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/real-estate-buyer-process.png&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/real-estate-buyer-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buyer process&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-selling-process&quot;&gt;The Selling Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this next bit, I call up estate agents this time seeking assistance in selling my house. I then clarify the process after having called several estate agents and figured out a cohesive process map for the selling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seller calls up the estate agent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estate agent comes in and takes photos of the property&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estate agent suggests the price, according to current market conditions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once price is decided, the agent posts the property on the various channels (website, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the buyer decides on purchasing the property, a price negotiation is conducted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the buyer decided to proceed, they both meet at the notary and sign over the title deed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/real-estate-seller-process.png&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/real-estate-seller-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;Seller process&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deciding-on-a-problem&quot;&gt;Deciding on a problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I have several candidates for problems to sovle — all of them from notes I picked up during the buying process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve listed what seem to be the most promising candidates here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The issue of handling keys. In the instances I witnessed, the agents either had to drive out of their way to get the keys from someplace, or were just unable to provide the keys at all because they didn’t have them handy. I already have several ideas for solutions, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agents ask for the price of the property in order to identify which one you’re talking about. Do they not have an app for this? How do they track their properties? Worth exploring… Also tied to two other issues:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Offered homes for viewing that were not listed on the site&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The issue where the agent didn’t know the status of the home because the owner was non-responsive.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I need to talk to some real estate agents to see if this is something that might actually fly — since they would be the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled up LinkedIn, and started searching for 1st and 2nd degree connections with people in the real-estate industry, specifically agents and owners of agencies. I also decided to put together a draft to ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bahrainpropertyworld.com/bahrain-property-and-real-estate-agents/&quot;&gt;a whole list of real-estate agents&lt;/a&gt; that I had no relation with. Mind you, this was a list of agencies, not agents — so I’d still have to do a bunch of digging to find the contact details for specific agents. Still, totally doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I need a script. Here’s what I used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey [Name]? ⏸  My name’s Yazin, I’m a business student working on a project to help real-estate agents. Could you help answer some questions for me? It’ll only be a few minutes ⏸  Great. Let’s say I was looking to buy a house. How would you look up the details of the property? Do you have some sort of system you use, or is it something more basic? ⏸  Ok, and how does that work if you’re outside the office? ⏸  Great, now my last set of questions are going to be about the keys to the houses on sale. Do the owners usually keep the keys or do you hold on to them? ⏸  Where do you usually keep them? ⏸  What happens if another real-estate agent has a client that wants to see the property? ⏸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I put together the list of agents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZljRuyjHNza7LeJUMpNwgVITKTvT4nyVzNXZ0aKV2FQ/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;amp;single=true&amp;amp;widget=true&amp;amp;headers=false&quot; style=&quot;width:100%; height:400px;border:1px solid #ccc;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and started talking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was originally planning on speaking to all 55 agents in the list, but I found that the answers were pretty much all the same after #8, so I didn’t see a reason to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to learn that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys problem&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In most cases, the property keys are kept with the property owners. In the remaining ~20% of cases, they are either kept with property managers, security guard/watchmen or are handed over to the real estate agent (in case of an exclusive arrangement between owner and agent).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If another agent refers a client, then they split the commission (often down the middle). However, there’s a database of properties for sale/on rent that’s used by many real estates which lists the contact details of the owners. This means that in some cases, the real estate agent with the client can cut out the listing agent and close the deal with the owner directly. It’s unclear how big of an issue this is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve learned, the key problem seems more worthwhile to pursue but it’s obviously &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be a pure software solution. Some hardware would be needed to grant/revoke access to the property, even if it’s just &lt;a href=&quot;https://toor.today&quot;&gt;a lockbox&lt;/a&gt; (that project appears to be dead btw, after the owner raised ~$500k from KickStarter &amp;amp; Shark tank).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems problem&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every agent uses some sort of system (even if that’s just basic Excel for small agencies), but none of them seemed to be aware that there was an issue — nor did they complain about it much.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are 12.5 million results on Google for “real estate CRM”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did come along another problem that I hadn’t thought about before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition problem&lt;/strong&gt;:
One thing I picked up from the conversations is that real estate agents have a dim view of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; real estate agents — and there’s always a worry that they are going to steal from each other. One particular example is how they don’t share all of the information pertaining to a property on their website, since that would mean other real estate agents might be able to see it too (and copy it). Of course, the more real estate agents know about a property, the more likely a buyer will end up seeing it, and the more likely it’ll get sold. However, real estate agents are not incentivized to work together, but work &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; each other in order to make a (commission-based) living. It is strange that things like address and nearby points of interest are hidden to prevent this “theft” from taking place. This means that the customer can’t know the exact location of the property without first contacting the estate agent. Additionally, it means that if he/she wanted to view mutliple properties in the same location — they’d need to coordinate with multiple agents and hope that they can line them all up in the same window. This is a sucky situation for all the parties involved: propspective buyer, agent and the seller. The only parties you really need in order to execute a buy/sell agreement is the buyer and the seller — the agent’s role should be to add value as a middleman, not get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to take a step back, let’s consider the value proposition of using an agent in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They can do viewings for the owner, so the owner doesn’t have to show up to the property every time a prospective buyer comes by.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They (supposedly) help find buyers. I say supposedly, since many people today seem to find properties (either via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bahrainpropertyworld.com/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propertyfinder.bh/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bestbahrainproperties.com/en/&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://century21.bh/&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://bahrain.youramlak.com/&quot;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bahrainpropertylocators.com/&quot;&gt;existence&lt;/a&gt;, or by just passing by a property with a sign).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the downsides…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They take a fee from both the seller (~2%) and the buyer (1%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They don’t always have the best interest of the buyer OR the seller at heart. Since they get paid a % of the sale price, their goal is to maxmimize that price. That’s obviously bad for buyers, but it’s also bad for the seller if they’re looking to sell on some sort of timeline (and not wait forever).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Their scattered nature means that you often have to talk to mulitple agents to see a group of properties in the same location (no one agent has access to all of the properties; they might not even be aware of all of them in the first place).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first impression is: wow, that’s nuts. I mean, there’s got to be more to what estate agents do than just (literally) unlocking doors and putting up signs! Maybe there’s some psychological element I’m overlooking — a sense of security knowing that you’re dealing with someone who’s sold tens of houses before and know’s what they’re doing. Yeah, may be. Still, it seems really overpriced for what you’re getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first impression is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3001334/want-disrupt-industry-try-actually-working-it-first&quot;&gt;before I cross them off as useless, it’s a good idea to get in their shoes&lt;/a&gt; for a while… see what it feels like to actually get people to buy/rent a property, and then figure out whether they do indeed add value or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m working on a side-project so this’ll be on hold for a few days while I see what transpires with the other idea. Expect an update on Wed, 19th July.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yazin Alirhayim</name><email>hi@yazin.co</email></author><summary type="html">This isn't a particular idea, but a possibility. I've had very little experience with real estate, but I'm sure there's a way to make it at least 10x better, either for the buyer or for the agents themselves.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Validator</title><link href="https://yazin.co/the-validator/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Validator" /><published>2017-06-30T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2017-06-30T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://yazin.co/the-validator</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yazin.co/the-validator/">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/the-gforms-idea/&quot;&gt;GForms’s Landing page&lt;/a&gt; took me about 10 days to build, launch and validate — most of it spent on the damn front-end making sure everything looked OK on mobile and desktop. Once I ran the experiment, within 24 hours I knew it was not going to fly. The question is, could I have finished it sooner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea is to make a simple tool that helps you validate an idea quickly. No more slogging through creating a landing page, hooking up Intercom, etc. A/B testing messaging and running experiments. This tool has all the best practices built-in, and makes the process smooth as silk. $99/month, and you’ll still save so much time and money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea anyway. Let’s see if it picks up any steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach-to-validation&quot;&gt;Approach to Validation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one, as ever, is to validate your riskiest assumption. Let’s break out the busines model canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-model-canvas&quot;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/business-model-canvas-validate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Business Model Canvas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;landing-page&quot;&gt;Landing Page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, with that out of the way it’s clear that I’m going to need a landing page to test things out. I decided to build it using a landing page builder (as opposed to hand-coding it, which took forever &lt;a href=&quot;/the-gforms-idea/&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;). I settled on &lt;a href=&quot;http://instapage.com&quot;&gt;InstaPage&lt;/a&gt;, and was able to get familiar with it pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process went like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open up Google Docs and type up the copy for the page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sketch the layout on paper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement it in InstaPage (I also used Mailchimp for collecting emails)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buy a domain (I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://validate.tech&quot;&gt;validate.tech&lt;/a&gt; for this experiment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all super-quick, and took just a few hours to put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the end result (Yeah, I know … super-long, and text-heavy):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/landing-page-validate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Landing Page - Validate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice a Login link there (that’s fake, and leads to an empty page with a fake login screen that does nothing) and an address (also fake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;launching-the-experiment&quot;&gt;Launching the experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we need to make sure we’ve got clear goals ahead of the experiment. Mine was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target visitor count: 1,000 visits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target conversion rate to payer: 1% (so, 10 * $49/mo. minimum = $490/mo.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have a payment flow setup, it would just ask for your email and then say “Thanks!” before you had a chance to pay — but it does show intent to pay, which is what I care about right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hackernews--producthunt&quot;&gt;HackerNews &amp;amp; ProductHunt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hackernews link &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14654999&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ProductHunt link &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/validate&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, the results were pretty dismal from both channels … the grand total was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/analytics-validate-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Analytics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;51 visitors; 0 conversions. Damn, that’s horrible. The Google Forms idea raked in 1,000 visits per channel (2k visitors total) so I was expecting something similar. However, it seems that was naive — many people thought that the Google Forms idea was an &lt;em&gt;actual Google product&lt;/em&gt;, and hence the interest. This idea didn’t have that going for it, so no free ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm. I need to figure out a way to get more traffic so that the results are at least statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reddit--everything-else&quot;&gt;Reddit &amp;amp; everything else&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to get more visits, I made sure to submit it everywhere where my target audience might hang out. This included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6khslc/test_your_startup_idea_in_under_24_hours/&quot;&gt;r/programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/351961/how-can-i-effectively-test-a-product-idea-before-building-it&quot;&gt;Software Engineering @ StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; — yes, I posted a question linking to my site so folks would click it. Shoot me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t get me to 1,000 visits. Instead of spending money to get more visits (via ads), I decided to maximize the data I get per visit. I added &lt;a href=&quot;http://crazyegg.com&quot;&gt;CrazyEgg&lt;/a&gt; for both heatmaps (which they are well known for), as well as a new feature they’d launched called Recordings (which record everything the user does on your site). Here’s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/crazyegg-recordings-validate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Recordings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent. I waited till the next day for the results to come in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/analytics-validate-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Analytics - Take 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so that’s 100 more visits since yesterday. When digging through the CrazyEgg logs, I noticed something interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/analytics-try-clicks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Clicks on Try Validate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like 5% of visitors were interested in “Try Validate”, a button I’d added at the bottom of the page that simply scrolls up to the pricing section. Hmm, maybe a free trial would’ve converted better than … well, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then checked the leads, and was surprised to see one lead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/leads-validate-one.png&quot; alt=&quot;Leads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, using a Gmail address for an enterprise plan does not seem promising — but hey, I sent an email out to Joe anyway to see why he signed up for a demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, that makes for a conversion rate of 1 / 150 = ~0.7% vs the goal of 1% — but again, this depends on how this Joe lead turns out. I’m (hopelessly?) optimistic it’ll pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: By the next day, I had 300+ visitors total (most of it from Reddit/programming). No improvement in leads though — still just the 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/analytics-validate-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Analytics - Final&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers speak for themselves — this experiment failed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yazin Alirhayim</name><email>hi@yazin.co</email></author><summary type="html">I found it very time consuming to test out the last 2 ideas, and I'm wondering if there's a quicker way to do that specifically for testing out product ideas. That's what I'll be testing with this experiment.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Gforms Idea</title><link href="https://yazin.co/the-gforms-idea/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Gforms Idea" /><published>2017-06-29T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2017-06-29T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://yazin.co/the-gforms-idea</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yazin.co/the-gforms-idea/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I actually ran this experiment about 2 weeks before I posted this, but wanted to document everything here — hence this post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s hit another idea and see what we can learn. This one goes like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A forms app that works on mobile and is offline. Maybe include an Android widget so you can tap, tap, done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subscription service, that offers the ability to submit Google Forms offline. I use GForms alot, and I’m betting there’s others out there that do too (how many there are remains a question that needs answering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the ability to submit forms offline means people that use it for expense tracking can do so painlessly, and from anywhere — those that use it for any other sort of mobile tracking can do the same. It would be very useful to a small set of people that (a) use Google Forms frequently and (b) are on the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I have no idea how the heck people could possibly use this (and indeed, if anyone would want to use this thing) — hence, the experiment. All I know is that there are many, many users of Google products and if even a small subset of those will find this beneficial, then there’s plenty of room to make a business here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach-to-validation&quot;&gt;Approach to Validation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;landing-page&quot;&gt;Landing Page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I didn’t use the Business Model Canvas like last time, since I don’t know what the use-case (and hence, the market) is for this product. Instead, I’ll use a landing page showing this feature — and launch it on HackerNews / ProductHunt. That way, I’ll guage the response and create a specific product based on the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what I’ll do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a simple landing page showing the main feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch it on HackerNews / ProductHunt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to signups and ask them why they signed up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a specific product based on feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hand-coded the landing page, though that turned out to be a very time-consuming process (especially having to make sure everything looked well on desktop and mobile). It would’ve made more sense to simple use &lt;a href=&quot;http://unbounce.com&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://instapage.com&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://optimizely.com&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wix.com&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; landing page tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/landing-page-gforms.png&quot; alt=&quot;Landing Page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once you hit the “Try it” button, you get a simple modal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/modal-gforms.png&quot; alt=&quot;Modal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you press the “How it Works”, it cycles through a series of device screenshots that demonstrate the apps functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/landing-page-gforms-screens.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screens&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emails are submitted to a Google Firebase database so the whole page is static. I then booked the domain &lt;a href=&quot;http://formsapp.me&quot;&gt;formsapp.me&lt;/a&gt; and put it up (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dokku/dokku&quot;&gt;Dokku&lt;/a&gt;, a roll-your-own Heroku solution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;launching-the-experiment&quot;&gt;Launching the experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before launching, I had to set a clear goal for what the target response rate would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures I put down were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target visitor count: 1,000 visits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target conversion rate to subscriber: 20% (since it’s free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, it was time to launch the landing page. I chose HackerNews and ProductHunt as my channels of choice — since that’s where the most likely target customer base lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hackernews&quot;&gt;HackerNews&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was simple enough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/landing-page-gforms-hackernews.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hacker News submission&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14580353&quot;&gt;submitted it&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;producthunt&quot;&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a bit more involved. I had to submit the screenshots of the (make-believe) mobile app along with an icon. I noticed that GIF images were more likely to grab attention, so I made one quickly to go along with the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the submission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/formsapp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/landing-page-gforms-producthunt.png&quot; alt=&quot;ProductHunt submission&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited for 24 hours, and then checked Google Analytics for results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gforms-analytics-result.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Analytics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not bad. I managed to score 2,000 visits in total after just 1 day. I also checked the database, but that was much less encouraging: I only managed to get 14 emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That meant a dismal conversion rate of 14 / 2000 = 0.7% (a far cry from the 20% rate I’d set). And I wasn’t even asking for any money..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I decided I’d reach out to the 14 emails and ask them for their feedback. I sent out to the following email to the folks that signed up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gforms-email.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get several responses from the people I reached out, a total of 5 of the 14 responded — and all of them said that they were B (just curious).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers have spoken — this idea is officially dead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yazin Alirhayim</name><email>hi@yazin.co</email></author><summary type="html">I use Google Forms alot, primarily to track my finances (and also with calorie counting).

The description I had from &lt;a href=&quot;/ideas/&quot;&gt;the Ideas list&lt;/a&gt; is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The way that large companies propagate high-level goals down from leadership to employees across the company is broken. It ends up becoming a formality, done over Powerpoint slides twice a year (beginning and end, during performance reviews). This is a lost opportunity, one where goals could serve as the glue that ties employees daily work towards a greater company objective. Coupled with transparency, employees can see exactly how they impact the greater goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach-to-validation&quot;&gt;Approach to Validation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-model-canvas&quot;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is the first idea I’ll be validating, I’d like to try out the most obvious method — the infamous Business Model Canvas. So I fill it in like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/business-model-canvas-goals-idea.png&quot; alt=&quot;Business Model Canvas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent about 30 minutes filling that in (I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanstack.com/&quot;&gt;LeanStack&lt;/a&gt; to get it done). Ok, the idea was pretty vague when I started — and now it does seem &lt;em&gt;abit&lt;/em&gt; more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;riskiest-assumption&quot;&gt;Riskiest Assumption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step would be to “validate my riskiest assumption”. I’ll list down all of the assumptions I have going on (aside from the canvas, in it’s entirety):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large companies still share goals via Powerpoint slides twice a year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large companies &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; transparency in their goals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees are incentivized to use the tool and can benefit from it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge I’m sensing in this goal is a greater one — one that relates to product adoption. How the heck am I going to convince a large corporation (one with 1k+ employees) to pay for a tool that doesn’t yet exist — and for a problem that they may not even be aware they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tall order indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s our concern then: &lt;strong&gt;do customers know they have a problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have no intention of building the product without paying customers lined up, I’m necessarily going to have to start with smaller companies (&amp;lt;100 employees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;validate-it&quot;&gt;Validate It&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to test out this assumption, I decided to run some interviews. For this, I primarily relied on &lt;a href=&quot;http://customerdevlabs.com/2013/11/05/how-i-interview-customers/&quot;&gt;Justin Wilcox’s proven interviewing tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My process was simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to small businesses (with between 10 - 100 employees)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interview the Founder/CEO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analyze results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach out to the founders, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattermark.com&quot;&gt;MatterMark’s dashboard search&lt;/a&gt;. It’s awesome because it lets you search companies by number of employees. I then wrote emails out to the Founder/CEO’s of the first 50 companies on the list. The email address is often firstname@company.domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what one of those emails looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/email-strategy-interview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected to hear back from half of the folks — so about 25 (especially since I offered to compensate them for their time, something I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/74338272&quot;&gt;Jason Cohen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also drafted a few questions that I’d ask in the interview. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who defines the strategy for the company?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is it communicated with the employees?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What tools do you use?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How often is the strategy revisited with the employees to align tasks with larger goals?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was more to guide the discussion — I expected to be asking alot if “why” questions too, to understand what was going on underneath the surface. I did not plan to do &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; selling on this call — that would happen later, once we’ve validated that customers are aware of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 0 positive responses within 3 days of sending the email out. 5 people replied to kindly say no, they were not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s reasonable to assume that if they really did have a hard time communicating the company strategy throughout the organization, they would’ve replied (barring some sort of email deliverability issue, which I knew was not the case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revisiting-the-business-model-canvas&quot;&gt;Revisiting the Business Model Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to my business model canvas, and thought about my definition of early adopter. It was, of course, super-general. Maybe there was some way to narrow it down to a smaller group that face a more severe variant of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal group of early adopters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have the problem you defined&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;know they have the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;are paying to “solve it” (albeit, inadequately)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks I’m reaching out to meet none of these criteria (which may be why the acceptance rate is so dismal). Seems like I’ll need to be much more specific about what folks I’m looking for here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the problem more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to help &lt;strong&gt;entrepreneurs&lt;/strong&gt; solve their &lt;strong&gt;strategy communication&lt;/strong&gt; problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t seem to be able to &lt;strong&gt;define&lt;/strong&gt; the problem, and therefore I can’t even begin to fix it. I’ve tried searching for externally observable behaviors that suggest that this problem exists (e.g. “i don’t know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to work on! too many tasks on &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;”) on Twitter but couldn’t find anything. I also tried searching for blog posts, etc. and also came up short. So while this problem may seem like it might exist somewhere, I have no conceivable way of detecting (let alone reaching) those that have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, there’s nothing more to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiment failed, because I was unable to find people that face the purported problem this idea solves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yazin Alirhayim</name><email>hi@yazin.co</email></author><summary type="html">This is the first idea I'm testing. The idea is one I've had for a while, since my time at GE.

&lt;p&gt;Finding something to work on can be daunting. When you choose to work on something, you’re also choosing &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to work on countless other things. The FOMO beast in me wreaks havoc at the mere mention of such a quandary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I do? How can I take a decision — the right decision — at a time when there are so many things going on in so many different fields. For a split second, I want to dive into all of them: Biotechnology, Nutrition, Self-driving cars, Machine Learning, Nanotechnology, Bitcoin, Drones and so many more! There’s so much to learn, and so &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; time! (It doesn’t help that I’m addicted to learning, and enjoy it immensely — even for it’s own sake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I come back to my senses, I realize that’s why it’s crucial to have a framework for making decisions: a plan, based on a &lt;em&gt;key insight&lt;/em&gt; . Similar to how Jeff Bezos, all those years ago, decided that books would be a great foundation for starting an eCommerce company, since there are way too many titles to keep under one roof: since variety is key, this lead to the ultimate defensible business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so simple — but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in retrospect. The idea now is to come up with such insights looking forward, and building a defensible business upon a key insight — essentially, to pull a “Jeff Bezos”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;approach&quot;&gt;Approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-level approach is a simple one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get as many ideas as possible. The more, the merrier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mercilessly kill the bad ideas. Oh, and make sure you do it quickly and painlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post will include a framework I devised for brainstorming ideas based on my unique experiences and interests. The approach is one that can be generalized to your case, with a little bit of self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-alot-of-ideas&quot;&gt;Getting alot of ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-obvious-way-brainstorming&quot;&gt;The obvious way (Brainstorming)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious way to generate alot of ideas is to just do a brain-dump. Grab a bunch of sticky notes, a marker and write out as many ideas as you can in 5 minutes. The limitation with this approach though is that the results are inconsistent — and the ideas you get are largely influenced by whatever it is your brain was busy thinking about &lt;em&gt;at that specific time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-methodical-way&quot;&gt;The methodical way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the limitations of the first method, I decided to also use a more methodical approach for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the post describes this methodical approach in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations for finding a business idea:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ride a Technological Wave&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My Background &amp;amp; Expertise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider Regional Challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-ride-a-technological-wave&quot;&gt;① Ride a Technological Wave&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some technologies today that are going to fundamentally change how existing businesses operate. This is the perfect time to pick those up, understand the implications that they might have on incumbents and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be thorough about this would require exhaustive study of all technological changes, and a detailed dive into each one to understand how it might affect existing markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VCs are perfectly positioned to write about these things, since they are on the receiving end of many startup proposals (many of which are built on top of existing technological waves).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can benefit from their insight here to help us get from a broad matrix of markets and technologies to a more narrowly focused list that I can then select from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-my-background--expertise&quot;&gt;② My Background &amp;amp; Expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal startup will build on my strengths — both industry-specific and otherwise. While it’s certainly possible to excel in a field I have no experience in (I knew nothing about credit cards before White), it’s preferable to choose one that I know well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take stock of what areas I’m good at, and have experience in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gemeasurement.com/condition-monitoring-and-protection&quot;&gt;Condition Monitoring &amp;amp; Vibration Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lean Six Sigma&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SAP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Print Industry (print.bh)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fine Art Canvas (canvas.bh)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online Payments &amp;amp; Credit Cards (whitepayments.com)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drones (Teleport)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These span multiple industries (⚡️ Energy, 🖨 Print, 💲 Payments) and disciplines (Engineering, Quality, Founder, Product).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Strengths:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I learn &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; . I savor the acceleration in learning (going from 0% knowledge about something→80% of it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have an innate ability to simplify complicated things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I know how to plan, and plan well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open to feedback, in all it’s forms. No matter how harsh.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;complexities&lt;/em&gt; worst enemy. I can take super complicated things, and break them down into bite-size, easy-to-understand chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Weaknesses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I hate slogging through the remaining 20% (from 80→100%).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can make the high-level plan, and execute the big juicy parts of it — but won’t comb through the minutiae.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;-consider-regional-challenges&quot;&gt;③ Consider Regional Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of this talk about technological change will influence the world equally. The Middle East is still behind the US in some fundamental aspects of doing business e.g. logistics, payments and (perhaps as a result) eCommerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;All problems must be verified&lt;/em&gt; (we assume they are true, but they might not be)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High mobile penetration, low availability of &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; online services (Uber/Careem are notable exceptions). No clear market leader equivalent of eBay, Shyp, TaskRabbit, Stripe (or underlying ACH/SEPA for that matter). 
Recent entrants: Instashop (=Instacart).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key learning from my time in eCommerce: mobile is exploding, and people will buy online where there’s an incentive to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Financial inclusion: reaching the X-million people that don’t have bank accounts or credit cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of credit history for individuals and companies in the region&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of delivery infrastructure to non-core cities in Saudi Arabia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry-specific challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;⚡️ Energy
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The UAE has the largest per capita carbon footprint in the world [ &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.kpmg.com/ae/en/home/insights/2016/09/goinggreen-renewableopportunitiesintheuae.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , 2016]&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dependence on oil [ &lt;a href=&quot;http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Middle-East-Oil-Addiction-Could-Spell-Disaster.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , 2015]&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cost of renewables without subsidies near parity with fossil fuel in the UAE [ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/energy-science-center-dam/events/the-global-energy-challenge/steven-hartman-ge-presentation.pdf&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , Pg8, 2017]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🖨 Print
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Print industry in Middle East is … booming? [ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smitherspira.com/news/2017/march/middle-east-presents-new-boom-market-for-print&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; , 2017]. They still have to contend with lower and lower prices though.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;💲 Payments
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Still no way for individuals to process online payments, without having to get a Trade License (for AED10k+). Stripe users &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.stripe.com/questions/sole-proprietor-without-federal-ein&quot;&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No Payouts infrastructure available for doing cheap/free bank transfers across the UAE (nevermind the region)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Transfers across the region go through SWIFT, and cost ~AED50/transfer (plus currency exchange fees)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this all work, I’ll start by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matching technologies up with my strengths/background&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tying the resulting list with the list of the region’s problems to check suitability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a key insight for each remaining idea _ (where possible)_&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I also want to leave room for random ideas that might not necessarily have surfaced through any of the previous steps. It’s totally fine to not overthink them, as long as we develop a quick way to test these ideas for viability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yazin Alirhayim</name><email>hi@yazin.co</email></author><summary type="html">The first step is finding an idea, one of the most intimidating parts of this whole process.
