Hey there. The name's Yazin Alirhayim, and I'm trying to figure out this SaaS thing. 

Over the years, I've watched along as many people I follow have gone on to start successful SaaS businesses &mdash; well, I'm done watching. It's time to pull my sleeves up and get the work done.

## My Goal

To reach $5,000 in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) within 4 months (inspired by [Nathan Barry's Web App Challenge](http://nathanbarry.com/category/the-web-app-challenge/))

## My Pledge

- I pledge to do everything humanly possible to get this off the ground. Yes, this is going to be a full-time deal.
- I want this to be the **most transparent project in existence**. I will share *everything* on this site, and I do mean *everything*. My hope is that the stuff I'm writing here will help someone out with their own attempt to create their own business.

## Inspiration

A big part of the inspiration for this project is the work of [Nathan Barry](http://nathanbarry.com/). I originally discovered Nathan's work through his book Authority, but later read up on [his journey](http://nathanbarry.com/category/the-web-app-challenge/) to create a SaaS business. However, at the time he started his business, Nathan already had a pretty hefty following (~50k+ subscribers, if I recall correctly). I don't. That makes this challenge slightly different and &mdash; I'm hoping &mdash; more applicable to you.
