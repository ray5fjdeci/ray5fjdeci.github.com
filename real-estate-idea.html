  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a well-defined idea, and I still don’t know what to test — or indeed, whether there’s anything to do here. I do know that people in Bahrain buy &amp; sell real-estate the same way they have in the pre-web era. The only difference is that now there’s a bunch of websites (really, not very different than catalogs, or newspaper classifieds) that advertise properties. The transaction is always initiated via a phone call, followed by a site visit.</p>

<p>There’s certainly room for improvement — but before doing anything, the first step has to be about discovery. Don’t try to fix something you don’t fully understand.</p>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>

<p>There are many ways to understand the “real estate process”; you could ask the agents, people that want to buy a property, or the owners — those are the primary parties involved.</p>

<p>Instead, and because I know very little about the space, I’ll start by attempting to buy a property (masquerading as a buyer). This will allow me to start at the beginning (a buyer shows interest), and then branch out to the other process directions (how did the owner list the property?) and (how does the realtor close the sale).</p>

<p>Oh, and I’ll do this until I feel like I’ve nailed the process (i.e. I can predict exactly what steps the next realtor will follow, to the t). That’ll probably take about 30 tries to do, maybe more. We’ll see…</p>

<h3 id="the-buying-process">The Buying Process</h3>

<p>I setup viewings for 8 properties with various real-estate agents, and sourced through multiple websites. Here’s a list:</p>

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXSc5S8ijY2ShoBPCKH3O6WUlaLJoOVJTm-7HsWib7A/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" style="width:100%;height:350px;border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>

<p>Having gone through all of these viewings, here’s what the process looks like (from the Buyers perspective):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Buyer sets up viewing with agent via phone call (obtained from a website)</li>
  <li>Agent gets the keys</li>
  <li>Agent meets the buyer at the house</li>
  <li>Agent walks the buyer through the house</li>
  <li>Agent shows adjacent properties</li>
  <li>After being shown the properties, the majority of buyers “disappear”</li>
  <li>Buyer decides on house</li>
  <li>Buyer negotiate price with owner via agent</li>
  <li>Owner obtains No Objection Certificate from government after paying all the charges</li>
  <li>Downpayment of BHD5,000 in order to take house off the market while the bank loan is underway</li>
  <li>Setup bank loan</li>
  <li>Proceed to notary for transfer of the title deed</li>
  <li>All done</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what it looks like visually, with some notes of the things I found odd:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/real-estate-buyer-process.png"> <img src="/assets/real-estate-buyer-process.png" alt="Buyer process" /> </a></p>

<h3 id="the-selling-process">The Selling Process</h3>

<p>For this next bit, I call up estate agents this time seeking assistance in selling my house. I then clarify the process after having called several estate agents and figured out a cohesive process map for the selling process.</p>

<p>Here’s the list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seller calls up the estate agent</li>
  <li>Estate agent comes in and takes photos of the property</li>
  <li>Estate agent suggests the price, according to current market conditions</li>
  <li>Once price is decided, the agent posts the property on the various channels (website, etc.)</li>
  <li>If the buyer decides on purchasing the property, a price negotiation is conducted</li>
  <li>If the buyer decided to proceed, they both meet at the notary and sign over the title deed</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/assets/real-estate-seller-process.png"> <img src="/assets/real-estate-seller-process.png" alt="Seller process" /> </a></p>

<h3 id="deciding-on-a-problem">Deciding on a problem</h3>

<p>At this point, I have several candidates for problems to sovle — all of them from notes I picked up during the buying process.</p>

<p>I’ve listed what seem to be the most promising candidates here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The issue of handling keys. In the instances I witnessed, the agents either had to drive out of their way to get the keys from someplace, or were just unable to provide the keys at all because they didn’t have them handy. I already have several ideas for solutions, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</li>
  <li>Agents ask for the price of the property in order to identify which one you’re talking about. Do they not have an app for this? How do they track their properties? Worth exploring… Also tied to two other issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Offered homes for viewing that were not listed on the site</li>
      <li>The issue where the agent didn’t know the status of the home because the owner was non-responsive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Next, I need to talk to some real estate agents to see if this is something that might actually fly — since they would be the customer.</p>

<p>I pulled up LinkedIn, and started searching for 1st and 2nd degree connections with people in the real-estate industry, specifically agents and owners of agencies. I also decided to put together a draft to ask <a href="https://www.bahrainpropertyworld.com/bahrain-property-and-real-estate-agents/">a whole list of real-estate agents</a> that I had no relation with. Mind you, this was a list of agencies, not agents — so I’d still have to do a bunch of digging to find the contact details for specific agents. Still, totally doable.</p>

<p>Next, I need a script. Here’s what I used:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey [Name]? ⏸  My name’s Yazin, I’m a business student working on a project to help real-estate agents. Could you help answer some questions for me? It’ll only be a few minutes ⏸  Great. Let’s say I was looking to buy a house. How would you look up the details of the property? Do you have some sort of system you use, or is it something more basic? ⏸  Ok, and how does that work if you’re outside the office? ⏸  Great, now my last set of questions are going to be about the keys to the houses on sale. Do the owners usually keep the keys or do you hold on to them? ⏸  Where do you usually keep them? ⏸  What happens if another real-estate agent has a client that wants to see the property? ⏸</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, I put together the list of agents:</p>

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZljRuyjHNza7LeJUMpNwgVITKTvT4nyVzNXZ0aKV2FQ/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" style="width:100%; height:400px;border:1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>

<p>… and started talking!</p>

<p>I was originally planning on speaking to all 55 agents in the list, but I found that the answers were pretty much all the same after #8, so I didn’t see a reason to continue.</p>

<p>I was able to learn that:</p>

<p><strong>Keys problem</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In most cases, the property keys are kept with the property owners. In the remaining ~20% of cases, they are either kept with property managers, security guard/watchmen or are handed over to the real estate agent (in case of an exclusive arrangement between owner and agent).</li>
  <li>If another agent refers a client, then they split the commission (often down the middle). However, there’s a database of properties for sale/on rent that’s used by many real estates which lists the contact details of the owners. This means that in some cases, the real estate agent with the client can cut out the listing agent and close the deal with the owner directly. It’s unclear how big of an issue this is.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Systems problem</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every agent uses some sort of system (even if that’s just basic Excel for small agencies), but none of them seemed to be aware that there was an issue — nor did they complain about it much.</li>
  <li>There are 12.5 million results on Google for “real estate CRM” :)</li>
</ol>

<p>From what I’ve learned, the key problem seems worthwhile to pursue.</p>
