  This isn't a particular idea, but a possibility. I've had very little experience with real
  estate, but I'm sure there's a way to make it at least 10x better, either for the buyer or
  for the agents themselves.

This is **not** a well-defined idea, and I still don't know what to test &mdash; or indeed, whether there's anything to do here. I do know that people in Bahrain buy &amp; sell real-estate the same way they have in the pre-web era. The only difference is that now there's a bunch of websites (really, not very different than catalogs, or newspaper classifieds) that advertise properties. The transaction is always initiated via a phone call, followed by a site visit.

There's certainly room for improvement &mdash; but before doing anything, the first step has to be about discovery. Don't try to fix something you don't fully understand.

## Discovery

There are many ways to understand the "real estate process"; you could ask the agents, people that want to buy a property, or the owners &mdash; those are the primary parties involved.

Instead, and because I know very little about the space, I'll start by attempting to buy a property (masquerading as a buyer). This will allow me to start at the beginning (a buyer shows interest), and then branch out to the other process directions (how did the owner list the property?) and (how does the realtor close the sale).

Oh, and I'll do this until I feel like I've nailed the process (i.e. I can predict exactly what steps the next realtor will follow, to the t). That'll probably take about 30 tries to do, maybe more. We'll see&hellip;
