Alright, let's hit another idea and see what we can learn. This one goes like so:

> A forms app that works on mobile and is offline. Maybe include an Android widget so you can tap, tap, done.

A subscription service, that offers the ability to submit Google Forms offline. I use GForms alot, and I'm betting there's others out there that do too (how many there are remains a question that needs answering).

Having the ability to submit forms offline means people that use it for expense tracking can do so painlessly, and from anywhere — those that use it for any other sort of mobile tracking can do the same. It would be very useful to a small set of people that (a) use Google Forms frequently and (b) are on the move.

Frankly, I have no idea how the heck people could possibly use this (and indeed, if anyone would want to use this thing) — hence, the experiment. All I know is that there are many, many users of Google products and if even a small subset of those will find this beneficial, then there's plenty of room to make a business here.

## Approach to Validation

### Landing Page

This time I didn't use the Business Model Canvas, since I'm not sure what the use-case (and hence, the market) is for this product. Instead, I'll use a landing page showing this feature &mdash; and launch it on HackerNews / ProductHunt. That way, I'll guage the response and create a specific product based on the feedback.

Essentially, what I'll do is:
- Create a simple landing page showing the main feature
- Launch it on HackerNews / ProductHunt
- Reach out to signups and ask them why they signed up
- Create a specific product based on feedback
