    <p>The <a href="/the-gforms-idea">GForms’s Landing page</a> took me about 10 days to build, launch and validate — most of it spent on the damn front-end making sure everything looked OK on mobile and desktop. Once I ran the experiment, within 24 hours I knew it was not going to fly. The question is, could I have finished it sooner?</p>

<p>You bet.</p>

<p>This idea is to make a simple tool that helps you validate an idea quickly. No more slogging through creating a landing page, hooking up Intercom, etc. A/B testing messaging and running experiments. This tool has all the best practices built-in, and makes the process smooth as silk. $99/month, and you’ll still save so much time and money!</p>

<p>That’s the idea anyway. Let’s see if it picks up any steam.</p>

<h2 id="approach-to-validation">Approach to Validation</h2>

<p>Step one, as ever, is to validate your riskiest assumption. Let’s break out the busines model canvas.</p>

<h3 id="business-model-canvas">Business Model Canvas</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/business-model-canvas-validate.png" alt="Business Model Canvas" /></p>

<h3 id="landing-page">Landing Page</h3>

<p>Ok, with that out of the way it’s clear that I’m going to need a landing page to test things out. I decided to build it using a landing page builder (as opposed to hand-coding it, which took forever <a href="/the-gforms-idea">last time</a>). I settled on <a href="http://instapage.com">InstaPage</a>, and was able to get familiar with it pretty quickly.</p>

<p>The process went like so:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open up Google Docs and type up the copy for the page.</li>
  <li>Sketch the layout on paper</li>
  <li>Implement it in InstaPage (I also used Mailchimp for collecting emails)</li>
  <li>Buy a domain (I used <a href="http://validate.tech">validate.tech</a> for this experiment)</li>
</ol>

<p>It was all super-quick, and took just a few hours to put together.</p>

<p>Here’s the end result (Yeah, I know … super-long, and text-heavy):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/landing-page-validate.png" alt="Landing Page - Validate" /></p>

<p>You’ll notice a Login link there (that’s fake, and leads to an empty page with a fake login screen that does nothing) and an address (also fake).</p>

<h3 id="launching-the-experiment">Launching the experiment</h3>

<p>Again, we need to make sure we’ve got clear goals ahead of the experiment. Mine was:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target visitor count: 1,000 visits</li>
  <li>Target conversion rate to payer: 1% (so, 10 * $49/mo. minimum = $490/mo.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t have a payment flow setup, it would just ask for your email and then say “Thanks!” before you had a chance to pay — but it does show intent to pay, which is what I care about right now.</p>

<h4 id="hackernews--producthunt">HackerNews &amp; ProductHunt</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Hackernews link <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14654999">here</a></li>
  <li>ProductHunt link <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/validate">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This time, the results were pretty dismal from both channels … the grand total was:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/analytics-validate-1.png" alt="Analytics" /></p>

<p>51 visitors; 0 conversions. Damn, that’s horrible. The Google Forms idea raked in 1,000 visits per channel (2k visitors total) so I was expecting something similar. However, it seems that was naive — many people thought that the Google Forms idea was an <em>actual Google product</em>, and hence the interest. This idea didn’t have that going for it, so no free ride.</p>

<p>Hmm. I need to figure out a way to get more traffic so that the results are at least statistically significant.</p>

<h4 id="reddit--everything-else">Reddit &amp; everything else</h4>

<p>In a bid to get more visits, I made sure to submit it everywhere where my target audience might hang out. This included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6khslc/test_your_startup_idea_in_under_24_hours/">r/programming</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/351961/how-can-i-effectively-test-a-product-idea-before-building-it">Software Engineering @ StackExchange</a> — yes, I posted a question linking to my site so folks would click it. Shoot me.</li>
</ul>

<p>This won’t get me to 1,000 visits. Instead of spending money to get more visits (via ads), I decided to maximize the data I get per visit. I added <a href="http://crazyegg.com">CrazyEgg</a> for both heatmaps (which they are well known for), as well as a new feature they’d launched called Recordings (which record everything the user does on your site). Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/crazyegg-recordings-validate.png" alt="Recordings" /></p>

<p>Excellent. I waited till the next day for the results to come in:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/analytics-validate-2.png" alt="Google Analytics - Take 2" /></p>

<p>Ok, so that’s 100 more visits since yesterday. When digging through the CrazyEgg logs, I noticed something interesting:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/analytics-try-clicks.png" alt="Clicks on Try Validate" /></p>

<p>Looks like 5% of visitors were interested in “Try Validate”, a button I’d added at the bottom of the page that simply scrolls up to the pricing section. Hmm, maybe a free trial would’ve converted better than … well, nothing.</p>

<p>I then checked the leads, and was surprised to see one lead:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/leads-validate-one.png" alt="Leads" /></p>

<p>Hmm, using a Gmail address for an enterprise plan does not seem promising — but hey, I sent an email out to Joe anyway to see why he signed up for a demo.</p>

<p>Technically, that makes for a conversion rate of 1 / 150 = ~0.7% vs the goal of 1% — but again, this depends on how this Joe lead turns out. I’m (hopelessly?) optimistic it’ll pan out.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Update: By the next day, I had 300+ visitors total (most of it from Reddit/programming). No improvement in leads though — still just the 1.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/analytics-validate-3.png" alt="Analytics - Final" /></p>

<p>The numbers speak for themselves — this experiment failed.</p>
